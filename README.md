# ðŸ“š DSA_JAVA

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** learning journey in **Java**!  
This repository documents my **daily progress**, problem-solving practice, and code implementations â€” helping me track my growth while building a strong problem-solving mindset.

Inspired by **Kunal Kushwaha's DSA series**, this is where I:
- Practice **daily coding**
- Organize my learning notes & solutions
- Enhance my logical thinking & problem-solving skills

---

## âœ¨ Goals

- Master core **Data Structures** (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.)
- Understand and implement **Algorithms** (Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, etc.)
- Solve problems consistently to improve **competitive programming** skills
- Track daily learning & progress in an organized way

## ðŸš€ Tech & Tools

- **Java** â€“ Main programming language
- **VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA** â€“ Code editor
- **GitHub** â€“ Version control & progress tracking

---

## ðŸ“ˆ My Learning Approach

1. **Watch & Learn** â€“ Follow Kunal Kushwaha's lectures
2. **Implement** â€“ Write Java code for each concept
3. **Practice** â€“ Solve multiple problems for mastery
4. **Reflect** â€“ Summarize learnings in notes
